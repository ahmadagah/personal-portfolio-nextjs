# Open API Agent

One set of tools that can be provided to an LLM to execute is the OpenAPI toolkit (`OpenAPIToolkit`). Many web applications now utilize backend REST APIs to handle client requests. To automatically produce code that interacts with such APIs, the OpenAPI standard allows an API developer to publish a specification of their API interface which allows this to happen.

Consider a snippet of the OpenAPI specification for the `xkcd` comic strip below. It contains the URL of the server hosting the APIs as well as endpoint paths for handling 2 API requests: one to fetch the current comic and one to fetch a specific comic given its `comicId`.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  description: Webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.
  title: XKCD
  version: 1.0.0
externalDocs:
  url: https://xkcd.com/json.html
paths:
  /info.0.json:
    get:
      description: |
        Fetch current comic and metadata.
  "/{comicId}/info.0.json":
    get:
      description: |
        Fetch comics and metadata by comic id.
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: comicId
          required: true
          schema:
            type: number
servers:
  - url: http://xkcd.com/
```
