# Document Searching

We can now query the vector database to find documents that are most similar to a question that we ask. The code below performs a similarity search on the vector database:

```python
def search_db(query):
    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query)
```

Running the Search
Run the code to invoke an interactive shell to search the database:

```bash
python 02_docsearch.py
```

Queries and Results
Show the document URLs that are returned for the following queries:

1. Tell me about the MS program
2. Tell me about the Cybersecurity certificate
3. Tell me about PCEP
4. Tell me about the capstone
