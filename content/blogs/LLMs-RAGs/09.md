# LLM Agents

Another common application for LLMs is to construct autonomous agents. Based on a user's query, such agents are able to operate in a loop in which they:

1. Produce their own plans.
2. Execute the plans.
3. View the results of execution.

When they have sufficient information to answer a particular query, they return it to the user and terminate.

Agents are typically configured with a set of tools that they can use to perform the execution.
