# Testing the Chain

We can now test the chain by running the code to invoke an interactive shell to perform queries:

```bash
python 03_query.py
```

Repeat the queries from the previous section to see what is returned. Use the content to verify the answers to subsequent questions:

Tell me about the MS program
Tell me about the Cybersecurity certificate
Tell me about PCEP
Tell me about the capstone

Ask the following questions and show the responses:

How many credits does it take to complete the MS program?
How many core courses are there in the Cybersecurity certificate?
How many hours per week does a student work in PCEP?
How long is the capstone?
