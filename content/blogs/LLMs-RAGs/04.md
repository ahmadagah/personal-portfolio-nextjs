# Retrieval Augmented Generation Application

SSH into `linux.cs.pdx.edu`. Set an environment variable that contains the value of the API key generated in the previous step:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="<FMI>"
```

Note that you can add this to your .bashrc file to automatically set the key when you log in each time. Clone the course repository, change into the source directory containing the examples, create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wu4f/cs430-src
cd cs430-src/08*
git pull
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A simple RAG application is provided for you in the directory. Its goal is to answer questions based on the website of our Computer Science department. It is split into three main parts: a document loading part, a document searching part, and a document querying part.

For document loading, an HTML scraper is utilized. Portland State uses AWS's CloudFront to host its website, and access to the site programmatically requires an environment variable to be set that indicates the user's web client. Set it to your username:

```bash
export USER_AGENT='PDXAcademicClient/cs430'
```
