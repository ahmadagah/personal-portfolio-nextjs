# Google Generative AI API

We'll be using Google's Gemini Pro as one of our models. The model can be easily leveraged by programs running outside of Google Cloud. To do so, we'll first need to enable its API.

Run the following command to enable the API:

```bash
gcloud services enable generativelanguage.googleapis.com
```
