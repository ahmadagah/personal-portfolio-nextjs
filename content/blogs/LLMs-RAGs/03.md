# Set Up an API Key

## Option #1: Pay-as-you-go Tier

API keys that are in the pay-as-you-go tier need to be set up via Google's AI Studio at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com). Unfortunately, this site is restricted for the `@pdx.edu` domain. To work around this, navigate to **IAM & Admin** and click on **Grant Access**.

- Add a personal GMail account as an **Owner** of the project.
- After adding your personal GMail account as an owner, an invitation e-mail will be sent to the account. Accept the invitation and join the project.
- While logged into your personal GMail account, visit Google's AI Studio and get an API key. Select your cloud project when configuring the key.

## Option #2: Free Tier

If you do not wish to use a personal GMail account, you can issue a free-tier API key instead. To do so:

1. Visit your project's **APIs & Services** and navigate to the **Credentials** section.
2. Create a new API key.
3. Edit the key and restrict its access to the Generative Language API that we've just enabled.
